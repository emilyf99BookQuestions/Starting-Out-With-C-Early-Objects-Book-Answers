## Introduction
Book Description

"Gaddis covers objects and classes early after functions and before arrays and pointers. As with all Gaddis texts, clear and easy-to-read code listings, concise and practical real-world examples, and an abundance of exercises appear in every chapter. 
This text is intended for either a one-semester accelerated introductory course or a traditional two-semester sequence covering C++ programming."

Reading to refresh skills learnt in one module at University, learning fundamentals of C++ before starting personal projects.
